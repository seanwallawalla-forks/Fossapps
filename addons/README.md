# Fossapps Addons
The addons for Fossapps adds more functionality to toe Stock or Micro release of Fossapps.
System app remover addon

As I have discontinued the beta release of Fossapps, I turned its only feature from the normal release, being able to remove the system apps it replaces into its own small addon that can be easily flashed in Magisk Manager. Note that this Module is unreliable and may not remove all apps. It cannot remove apps in the /data partition

The MicroG addon installs all of the MicroG packages from microg.org. This can come handy for installing apps that require Google Services
Google Client Addon

Installs Aurora Store , Vanced Manager andGcam, Free and Open Source alternatives to the Google Play Store and YouTube and Google Camera.
